### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I am currently working on my Computer Science degree from Maryville University. This will be my second bachelors degree as I earned a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla.

ðŸ“ˆ I currently work for an Electric Utility here in St. Louis, MO where I oversee the construction of renewable electric generation plants such as wind and solar. However I have always enjoyed programming and thus I have started pursuing my passion as a viable career choice.
